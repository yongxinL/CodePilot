# Knowledge Base

## Overview

The Knowledge Base is a project-specific learning system that captures patterns, failures, and architectural decisions across all phases of development.

## Structure

### `/failures/`
Documents failure patterns encountered during development:
- Root causes
- Solutions applied
- Prevention strategies
- Links to replanning contexts

### `/patterns/`
Documents successful patterns discovered:
- Design patterns that worked well
- Architecture decisions that paid off
- Implementation approaches worth repeating
- Performance optimization techniques

### `/decisions/`
Index of key architectural and technical decisions:
- Cross-references to decision log entries
- Searchable by topic, date, phase
- Impact analysis over time

## Usage

### Adding a Failure
```bash
/kb add failure
```
CodePilot will guide you through documenting the failure.

### Adding a Pattern
```bash
/kb add pattern
```
Document successful approaches for future reference.

### Searching
```bash
/kb search [query]
```
Find relevant patterns or failures from past work.

## Benefits

- **Avoid Repetition:** Learn from past mistakes
- **Accelerate Development:** Reuse proven patterns
- **Preserve Knowledge:** Capture architectural rationale
- **Self-Evolving:** System gets smarter with each iteration

  - [ ] Equalized odds
- [ ] Disparate impact analysis performed

### Protected Attributes
- [ ] Sensitive attributes identified (race, gender, age, etc.)
- [ ] Protected attributes not used in discriminatory ways
- [ ] Proxy variables for protected attributes identified
- [ ] Mitigation strategies for bias implemented

### Explainability
- [ ] Decision-making process can be explained
- [ ] Model predictions are interpretable
- [ ] Users can understand why decisions were made
- [ ] Appeal mechanisms for automated decisions

### Harm Mitigation
- [ ] Potential harms identified and assessed
- [ ] Mitigation strategies implemented
- [ ] Monitoring for unintended consequences
- [ ] Incident response plan for ethical issues

## Regulatory Compliance

### GDPR (if applicable)
- [ ] Right to access implemented
- [ ] Right to deletion implemented
- [ ] Right to data portability supported
- [ ] Data processing agreements in place
- [ ] Privacy policy published

### Industry-Specific Regulations

# Rollback Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview
This document defines rollback procedures for emergency recovery.

## Git Rollback Commands

### By Phase Tag
| Target | Command | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Specification | `git checkout v0.1.x-spec` | Restart from requirements |
| Planning | `git checkout v0.2.x-plan` | Restart implementation |
| Implementation | `git checkout v0.3.x-impl` | Revert failed verification |
| Last Verified | `git checkout v0.4.x-verify` | Production rollback |

### Create Hotfix
```bash
git checkout v[X.Y.Z]
git checkout -b hotfix/description
# Apply fixes
git commit -m "fix: Description"
```

### Emergency Reset
```bash
# Reset to last known good state
git checkout develop
git reset --hard v[X.Y.Z]
```
